    <h2>Letter to my love</h2>

    <p><em>day in and day out, 
        <br>you remind me that when i’m with you it feels as if time hasn’t moved. 
        <br>brooke olivia santiago, 
        <br>i am infatuated with you and madly in love with you. 
        <br>i love the way your eyes make the stars look like they’re not shining. 
        <br>i love the way your hair falls perfectly without you trying. 
        <br>i love the way every time i compliment you, you blush and make such an adorable face. 
        <br>i love the way your lips blossom and flourish every time i see you, with oil, lip gloss and your natural lips, especially before they meet mine. 
        <br>i would kiss them all day if i could! 
        <br>i love the way you wheeze when you laugh, it brings out the most genuine smile out of me. 
        <br>i love your beauty and i tell you every time i can.</em>
